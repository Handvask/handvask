# USER

- As a user, I want to create a profile, so that I can access my files.
- As a user, I want to create a .mzn instance, so that I can define my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to read a .mzn instance, so that I can see my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to delete a .mzn instance, so that I can delete my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to create a .dzn instance, so that I can define the data for my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to read a .dzn instance, so that I can see the data for my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to delete a .dzn instance, so that I can delete the data for my MiniZinc model.
- As a user, I want to list the name of the solvers supported, so that I can see what options I have to choose from.
- As a user, I want to trigger the execution of one or more solvers, so that I can execute my MiniZinc model on multiple solvers concurrently.
- As a user, I want to select the solvers and use their options, to control the execution of the solvers.
- As a user, I want only the first optimal value found from the execution of multiple solvers, so that resources are not wasted.
- As a user, I want to monitor the termination state of the solver execution, so that I can monitor the current results of the execution.
- As a user, I want to retrieve the results of a terminated computation request, so that I can see what solver managed to solve it first and the time it took to solve it.
- As a user, I want to stop a solver for a specific request, so that I can stop the execution for the request for one of the solvers.
- As a user, I want GUI support, so that it will be easy to navigate the functionalities.

# Administrator

- As an administrator, I want to monitor and log the platform using a dashboard, so that I can easily get an overview of the platform.
- As an administrator, I want to kill all solver executions started by a user, so that I can stop bad actors from exploiting the system.
- As an administrator, I want to set resources quota for users, so that I can control the amount of resources used.
- As an administrator, I want to delete a user and all its data, so that I can manage the users and their data.
- As an administrator, I want to deploy the system and add new computing nodes in an easy way, so that I respond to demands easily.
- As an administrator, I want to add a solver, so that I can satisfy requests by users.
- As an administrator, I want to remove a solver, so that I can satisfy requests by users.
